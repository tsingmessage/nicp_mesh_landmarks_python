# nicp_mesh_landmarks_python
non-regid registration for mesh in python supporting landmarks

This repository is built upon: 
https://github.com/saikiran321/nonrigid_icp,
where landmarks were not supported



We also found the ICP here doesn't work properly, will fixt it later..
updates: can be solved by directly using an alternative ICP script: https://github.com/iitaakash/icp_python
